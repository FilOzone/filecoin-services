# Filecoin Services

Building Filecoin onchain programmable services that integrate with the Filecoin network for decentralized storage.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**🚨 THE WARM STORAGE CONTRACT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE 🚨**

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**

This software is provided for development, testing, and research purposes only. The smart contracts have not undergone comprehensive security audits and may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or other issues that could result in loss of funds or data.

**Use at your own risk. The developers and contributors are not responsible for any losses or damages.**

## Overview

This repository contains smart contracts and services for the Filecoin ecosystem, featuring:

- **FilecoinWarmStorageService**: A comprehensive service contract that combines PDP (Proof of Data Possession) verification with integrated payment rails for data set management
- **Payment Integration**: Built on top of the [Filecoin Services Payments](https://github.com/FilOzone/filecoin-services-payments) framework
- **Data Verification**: Uses [PDP verifiers](https://github.com/FilOzone/pdp) for cryptographic proof of data possession

## Pricing

The service uses static global pricing set by the contract owner (default: 2.5 USDFC per TiB/month). Rail payment rates are calculated based on data size with a minimum floor. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for details on rate calculation, pricing updates, and top-up/renewal behavior.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) - Ethereum development toolchain
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) - Command-line JSON processor (v1.7+ recommended)
- Git with submodule support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/filecoin-services.git
cd filecoin-services/service_contracts
```

2. Install dependencies and initialize submodules:
```bash
make install
```

3. Build the contracts:
```bash
make build
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

## 🌐 Deployed Contracts

Contract addresses for all supported networks are maintained in [service_contracts/deployments.json](./service_contracts/deployments.json), which is updated automatically as new deployments are published.

- Mainnet: chain ID `314`
- Calibnet (testnet): chain ID `314159`
