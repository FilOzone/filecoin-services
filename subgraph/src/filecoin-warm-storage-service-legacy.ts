/**
 * Legacy handler for FilecoinWarmStorageService
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Keeps old event formats indexable after contract upgrades (e.g., PieceAdded before pieceCid).
 *
 * Upgrade path:
 * - Export old ABI â†’ add legacy data source in subgraph.yaml
 * - Define handler here for that version
 * - Main handler tracks only the latest version
 *
 * Remove this once all data from old contracts is fully migrated or no longer needed.
